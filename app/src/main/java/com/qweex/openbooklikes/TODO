NOW
    - Loading views still suck ass in terms of being shown correctly
    - Shelves do not show after loading because ShelvesHandler inherits from ApiResponseHandler, not LoadingResponseHandler

LATER
    - Update current page for book
    - shelf counts on right of drawer menu
    - Make Loading Screen when logging in better (have some text or something)
    - AddBookToShelf

BUGS
    - posts in UserFragment are sometimes in incorrect order
      - possibly due to race condition:
        - perScreen() returned 0 so it immediately fetched more
        - 2nd fetch happened to finish first
      - UPDATED: changed perScreen() to 10 and problem persists
    - any <img> tags in, say, blog_desc will be replaced with [OBJ]
      - see 25022 (ethiercn)
      - also, can have multiple "<p>&nbsp;</p>" that leave a ton of blank space

MUCH LATER
    - FlowTextView to flow text around images
    - https://github.com/daimajia/NumberProgressBar
    - re-color the (currently green) drawer header
    - setting: custom default shelf/fragment
    - add background image to shelf view
    - better Login screen
    - About screen
    - truncate drawer entries that are too long?
    - Make drawer permanently expanded on tablets?
    - cache shelves?

NOTHER LIFETIME
    - Add shelf
    - Ability to search for book on Amazon; IndieBound; share on social media
    - Add post
    - Register
    - add "You are following this user" on other user's profile pages
    - When you scroll down on a Blog, the title sticks

FUCKING RETARDED (ignoring all the missing endpoints)
    - docs page is a mess
      - mispellings in parameters (usr_tokem, ) [poor grammar is one thing, but the params?]
      - different language ("redirect_url = url, na kt√≥ry nastapi przekierowanie po zalogowaniu")
      - doesn't say _why_ optional args are optiona (e.g. usr_token and uid)
      - naming is inconsistent ("BookIsWish" vs "Favorite", vs "usr_username")
      - GetBookstores is jut plain missing
    - "Private" is missing (private books are omitted from API)
      - But it can be set when adding book to shelf; meaning once added, it can't be retrieved via the API
    - Timeline is missing
      - nothing has "date_added" or similar (except for posts)
    - ?"Reviewed" is missing
    - difference between author/editor/contributor (all squished into "author"
    - Having "&quot;" in API responses
    - Publisher for 1591020646 has newlines and then trailing spaces
    - Dates are varying formats ("March 28th 2006" vs "2011-02-09")
    - Entities are Strings that shouldn't be
      - e.g. book_pages, post_is_review, post_tag
      - maybe usr_following_count?, usr_followed_count?, usr_book_count?
    - docs don't tell returned data types OR what the vars mean
      - example: book_format is a numerical string. wtf?
