FUCKING RETARDED (ignoring all the missing endpoints)
    - docs page is a mess
      - mispellings in parameters (usr_tokem, ) [poor grammar is one thing, but the params?]
      - different language ("redirect_url = url, na kt√≥ry nastapi przekierowanie po zalogowaniu")
      - doesn't say _why_ optional args are optiona (e.g. usr_token and uid)
      - naming is inconsistent ("BookIsWish" vs "Favorite", vs "usr_username")
      - GetBookstores is jut plain missing
    - "Private" is missing (private books are omitted from API)
      - But it can be set when adding book to shelf; meaning once added, it can't be retrieved via the API
    - Timeline is missing
      - nothing has "date_added" or similar (except for posts)
    - ?"Reviewed" is missing
    - difference between author/editor/contributor (all squished into "author"
    - Having "&quot;" in API responses
    - Publisher for 1591020646 has newlines and then trailing spaces
    - Dates are varying formats ("March 28th 2006" vs "2011-02-09")
    - Entities are Strings that shouldn't be
      - e.g. book_pages, post_is_review, post_tag
      - maybe usr_following_count?, usr_followed_count?, usr_book_count?
    - docs don't tell returned data types OR what the vars mean
      - example: book_format is a numerical string. wtf?
