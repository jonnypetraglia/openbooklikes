# OpenBookLikes #

OpenBookLikes is an open source Android app for [Booklikes.com](http://booklikes.com).
It's primary focus is personal use (as opposed to social) but really it can do everything that the
BookLikes developers put in their API.

OpenBookLikes is not affiliated with BookLikes in any way; it was made by a user who loves the site.
Please don't give them any flak if you hate it or whatever.


## Obtaining ##

For the moment, OpenBookLikes is not on any kind of app store, nor is it released in any way.
If you want to install and use it, you'll need to build it from source.
The project is built using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html),
which can be downloaded for free, and upon opening it as a Project there isn't much that should need
to be done.

You will need to get [your own API key](http://booklikes.com/dev/myapps) from BookLikes and paste it
into a values file (mine is called "confidential.xml") like so:
```<string name="api_key">your key goes here, yo</string>```

After that everything **should** work. Hypothetically.


## Contributing ##

This is a pet project so it's designed more as individual-driven than community-driven.
That being said, if someone would like to help in any way (from writing code to making assets to
testing), I'd be happy to try to work out something comfortable for the both of us.

OpenBookLikes is released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) open source

The license does not require you to submit any changes you make, but I'm asking you kindly to do so.
Forking is awesome but only when necessary, really. It benefits users much more to have one version
of an app that has all the fixes rather than them being dispersed over several versions. That being
said, if you have a legitimate reason (I've stopped working on the app, you disagree with me on
some fundamental changes you want made, or you just have a problem with authority) then by all
means, fork away.
